#!/usr/bin/env  python


#--- Purpose.
#
#   Manage a build process based on compiling and linking a bunch of object files.
#   Specifically, compile a number of source code files, and link the resulting
# object files into an executable or dynamic link library.


#--- Note on directory location.
#
#   This script can be run from any working directory, and does not need to
# reside in that working directory.
#   The only requirement is that the file names passed to the script must
# include the correct path to the files.


#--- Note on compile and link batch files.
#
#   This script uses separate, system-dependent, batch files to compile and
# link source code.  For more information, see fcns printCompileBatchInfo()
# and printLinkBatchInfo() below.


#--- Running this script.
#
#   To call this script from the Python interpreter, or from another Python script:
# >>> import <this-file-base-name>
# >>> <this-file-base-name>.manageCompileLink(arguments)

#--- Identify system.
