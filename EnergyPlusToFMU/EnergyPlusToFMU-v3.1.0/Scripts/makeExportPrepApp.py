#--- Purpose.
#
#   Create an executable that reads an EnergyPlus IDF file, and extracts the
# information needed to export the simulation as a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU)
# for co-simulation.


#--- Note on directory location.
#
#   This script uses relative paths to locate some of the files it needs.
# Therefore it should not be moved from its default directory.
#   However, this script can be run from a different working directory.


#--- Ensure access.
#

#--- Note on compile and link batch files.
#
#   This script uses separate, system-dependent, batch files to compile and
# link source code.  For more information, see fcns printCompileCppBatchInfo()
# and printLinkCppExeBatchInfo() below.
#

#--- Running this script.
#
#   To run this script from the command line:
# > python  [python options]  <this-file-name>  <arguments>
#
#   On unix-like systems, this command-line invocation should work as well:
# > ./<this-file-name>  <arguments>
#
#   To call this script from the Python interpreter, or from another Python script:
# >>> import <this-file-base-name>
# >>> <this-file-base-name>.makeExportPrepApp(arguments)


#--- Runtime help.
